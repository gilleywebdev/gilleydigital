<h1>About</h1>
<p><strong>Chris Gilley</strong> worked on his first website when he was just 11 years old, finding and adding links to a site for a <a href="http://www.gilleymedia.com/skillin/" target="_blank">fifth grade school project</a>. He graduated from <strong>South Portland High School</strong> in 2005 and <strong>Brandeis University</strong> in 2009 with a degree in Computer Science and economics.</p>
<p>After paying his dues (and student loans) at a larger agency, Chris started Gilley Web Development (now Gilley Digital) in 2011 to do interesting projects for interesting people in the Portland area.</p>
<p>When he's not coding up a storm, Chris can often be found playing the open mic at <strong>Dogfish Bar &amp; Grille</strong> or slinging cards at <strong>Crossroad Games</strong> in Standish.</p>
