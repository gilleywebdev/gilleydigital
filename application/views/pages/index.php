			<h2 class="column_header">Responsive Design</h2>
			<p>Your site will look right at home on <strong>mobile, tablet and desktop</strong> devices regardless of screen size. Give it a try now by resizing your browser window! <strong class="ie_only">(does not work in older versions of Internet Explorer, consider switching to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox">Firefox</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a>)</strong></p>
			<h2 class="column_header">Scalable Framework</h2>
			<p>Each new site is custom-built on a real programming framework, not a mashup of platforms and plugins. This allows me to create a <strong>unique &amp; seamless experience</strong>.</p>

			<h2 class="column_header">Content Management</h2>
			<p>Every site comes with an admin section that allows you and your employees to log in and <strong>easily make changes</strong> to the site, without needing to know any code.</p>
			<h2 class="column_header">Search Engine Optimization</h2>
			<p><strong>Clean code, descriptive titles and smart page structure</strong> means Google can navigate through your site just as easily as your users can.</p>
